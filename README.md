   - Rate its difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

3. **Review Problems**:
   - The extension will suggest problems to revisit based on your ratings.
   - Problems will be revisited according to the spaced repetition algorithm, and you can mark them as "Reviewed."

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the extension’s user interface and functionality.
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**: A technique used to determine when to revisit problems based on difficulty.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: Used to create and manage the extension's browser interface.

## Future Features

- **Advanced Problem Tracking**: Track your progress on multiple platforms and save your progress on the cloud.
- **Notifications**: Get notifications when it's time to revisit a problem.
- **Improved Algorithm**: Further refine the spaced repetition algorithm for optimal learning.
